"""State-dict transforms for TAEHV checkpoint variants.

Each known checkpoint (``lighttae``, FlashVSR ``TCDecoder.ckpt``, ...)
declares its own remap next to its URL in the consuming config and
threads it into :class:`~flashdreams.recipes.taehv.impl.TAEHV` via the
``state_dict_transform`` kwarg. The reusable building blocks live here;
:func:`compose` glues them together.
